# Bamazon
 This is a CLI app that uses a MySql database to display information to the user, which then can be edited at specific points all within the command line.

# What you need to get started:
  This app uses three different npm packages, which can be downloaded through the command line using the proper documentation.
  - mysql (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)
  - inquirer (https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
  - console.table (https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table)

# How it works:
 ## As a customer ##
  As a customer you will be able to see all of the available items in the database, and then will presented with the option to buy an item. If a purchase is made, the database is then altered to reflect that purchase. If not enough items are in stock to satisfy the user's request, the user is notified and the database remains unchanged. 
 ## As a Manager ##
  As a manager you are presented with four options: "View Products for Sale", "View Low Inventory", "Add to Inventory", "Add New Product". Selecting an option will display the appropriate information to the user, or will prompt the user for more information if it is needed.
